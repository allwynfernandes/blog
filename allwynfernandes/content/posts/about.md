### Talk to me about ðŸ‘‡

I am curious about a lot of things.

## About this website

This is my personal website, made by me. 
I am quite proud of how quick to load it is... brings me joy everytime.
It's hosted at my github repo and domain registered at [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com).
I like to mess around with themes. The current one (if I haven't changed it) is PaperMod by [Aditya](https://twitter.com/@adityatelange), chill dude, really.

To know more on how to use this website check out the [manual](/manual)

### Technical
The code for this website is hosted at [my Github repo](https://github.com/allwynfernandes). I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as my static site generator. I love how quick and easy to setup it is. 
I write my posts in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) using my knowledge management tool of choice: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
I use [this custom bash script](https://allwynfernandes.github.io/deploy-hugo-site-bash-script/) to build the site and push the code to github. It's not the most elegant but it does the job. Let me know if you have any improvements.
I am still not sure if I should enable comments on here since most of the talking happens on WA/HN/TW or where ever the posts are shared. Hit me up on email (at allwyn@allwynfernandes.com) if you think differently about this
