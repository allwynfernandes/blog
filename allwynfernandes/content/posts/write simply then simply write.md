It's kind of difficult to write what you think. The brain is a mess of ideas, plans and desires. Broken thoughts are abound. It's easier to instead write as you speak. Assuming speaking comes naturally to you.

I dont speak a lot with people. I've got a limited set of friends with whom I interact in limited ways. However, I seem to speak a lot with myself. Most of the thoughts and ramblings posted on this blog and the countless others in the journal come from that tête-à-tête 

It's difficult to be real like this especially when being fully aware that you will be judged for the content you put out there. Imposter syndrome is quite active in this space.

Most of the times my writing is quite straightforward and easy to read. However, sometimes it may sound out of place and the writing a bit strange even. At such times, it can be helpful to  look at the meta data-- The text at the top or bottom that mentions the tags the piece relates to, the sounds I was listening to, the place from where I wrote the entry and so on. 
They can provide useful context and [[UZ- Context gives meaning to concepts]]


It is necessary then to act and write as you say and say as you feel. This blog is an exploration of just that idea. I want to explore and express all these ideas that I keep coming across continually. I want to share them with others and hope that they gain something just as I've gained from countless others.

Here's to countless more days of sharing and learning,
Cheers!
